Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from 8:00 PM to 10:30 PM (UTC).
Impact: The outage affected our authentication service, rendering it inaccessible to 60% of users.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a sudden surge in traffic combined with a misconfiguration in the firewall settings.
Timeline:

8:00 PM: Monitoring alerts flagged an increase in error rates for the authentication service.
8:05 PM: Engineering team notified of the issue.
8:10 PM: Initial investigation focused on backend server logs to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
8:30 PM: Suspected database overload as the root cause due to increased traffic.
9:00 PM: Further analysis revealed abnormal network patterns indicating potential firewall issues.
9:30 PM: Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for firewall configuration review.
10:30 PM: Misconfigured firewall rules rectified, restoring service functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration in firewall settings blocked legitimate user requests, leading to service unavailability.
Resolution: Firewall rules were adjusted to allow traffic to the authentication service, resolving the accessibility issue.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated scaling mechanisms to handle sudden traffic spikes more efficiently.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into firewall traffic and configurations.
Tasks:
Conduct a thorough review of firewall configurations to identify and correct any additional misconfigurations.
Implement automated checks to validate firewall rules against best practices and security standards.
Develop a playbook for handling sudden traffic surges, including procedures for scaling resources dynamically.
Enhance communication channels for incident escalation and coordination to expedite resolution during future outages.
